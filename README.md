Poster archive from 2005-2007 of JHU ACM posters

These posters are designed to be printed on black and white.

Pre-requisites
=============

You will need to install the "Luxi Sans" font in order to be able to properly view the posters. If you don't have the font installed, you'll find the text probably looks like it doesn't fit properly in the boxes that are supposed to hold the text with this page design. The font is licensed under permissive, free software compatible terms, and you can get it online. For example:

* Click http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Luxi-Sans
* Click "Download TTF"
* In your OS, e.g. Ubuntu/Debian, open the ZIP file with the default GNOME-y ZIP tool (aka file roller)
* Select all the TTF fonts in the ZIP file by dragging the mouse over them, and right-click on the selection and click "Open with..." and choose the default, which should be some kind of Font Preview tool
* You should now have four instances of the Font Preview tool open, each one previewing a different variant of the font. Click "Install" to install the fonts (which in my experience does not need any special privileges).
* If you had LibreOffice/Open Office already open, quit it; then open it again.

You'll also need LibreOffice/Open Office to open the files.
